# Huffman_Coding
Lossless data compression

This script compresses information using the Huffman coding technique. Huffman encoding/decoding is a lossless data compression technique, it takes advantage of a priority queue and binary tree data structures to convert a text string into a string of bits. The decoding function can convert the bit string back into the original text.  This has a O(nlog(n)) time complexity and an O(n) space complexity.
